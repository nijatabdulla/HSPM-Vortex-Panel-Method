# HSPM Vortex Panel Method
This repository implements the HSPM Vortex Panel Method in Python, a classical numerical technique for predicting the aerodynamic characteristics of 2D airfoils. The method models the airfoil surface using discrete panels with vortex and source distributions, allowing calculation of pressure distribution, tangential velocity, and lift coefficient for any given angle of attack. It is suitable for educational purposes, preliminary airfoil analysis, and integrating into more advanced aerodynamic simulations.
